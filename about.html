  <!-- LEAD WITH URGENCY -->
  <section class="about-section section-fade">
    <h2>A Heritage at Risk</h2>
    <p>Tibetan language schools throughout China face systematic closure. The next generation of Himalayan Buddhists — scattered across the globe — increasingly lack the interest, inspiration, and opportunity to learn the language of their ancestral and spiritual lineage. With each passing year, the living connection between students and the original words of the Dharma grows thinner.</p>
    <p>The languages of the Buddhist tradition are not mere communication tools — they are the evolved vessels through which the essence of the Buddha's wisdom has been transmitted across millennia. Classical Tibetan and Sanskrit were developed and refined specifically to convey the profound subtleties of Buddhist philosophy and practice. These languages carry nuances, precision, and spiritual meaning that are inevitably diluted in translation.</p>
    <p>The preservation of these languages is not just important — it is <em>essential</em> to the continued transmission of the depth of the Dharma's wisdom.</p>

      <p>Kyabje Garchen Rinpoche presented his aspiration to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who shares the profound wish that the Tibetan language be preserved and strengthened on the global stage. His Holiness recognized the urgent necessity of this mission and blessed the vision and the project, seeing it as a fulfillment of his own life's work.</p>

    <h2>A Master's Final Wish</h2>
    <p>Kyabje Garchen Rinpoche has expressed that his final unfulfilled wish is to establish a comprehensive online language school to preserve and transmit the linguistic heritage of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition — securing it for generations to come.</p>
    <p>This platform will offer instruction in Sanskrit, Classical Tibetan, and Colloquial Tibetan, freely accessible to anyone in the world who wishes to learn. It is a gift of knowledge that transcends the geographical and financial barriers that have traditionally limited access to quality instruction in these sacred languages.</p>

  <!-- ADDRESSING THE NEED -->
  <section class="about-section section-fade">
    <h2>Addressing the Need</h2>
    <p>While traditional language schools exist, they remain out of reach for countless students who lack the flexibility to travel or the financial means required to attend. Authentic instruction in Classical Tibetan, Sanskrit, and spoken Tibetan has historically been available only to those with the privilege of proximity and resources.</p>
    <p>By investing in exceptional instructors and producing high-quality video instruction, we will make authentic language education available to students everywhere — a Khan Academy for the sacred languages of Buddhism. Free. Accessible. Uncompromising in quality.</p>
